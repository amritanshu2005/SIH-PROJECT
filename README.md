Smart Timetable Ace
AI-Based Timetable Generation System for Multidisciplinary Education Structures (NEP 2020 Aligned)
Problem Statement ID: ID25091
Organization: Government of Jammu and Kashmir, Higher Education Department

üöÄ Project Overview
The National Education Policy (NEP) 2020 has revolutionized the Indian higher education landscape by introducing flexible, credit-based, and multidisciplinary Four-Year Undergraduate Programmes (FYUP). This new structure, with its vast array of Major, Minor, Skill-Based, and Value-Added courses, has made traditional, manual timetable generation an incredibly complex and error-prone task.

Smart Timetable Ace is a deployable, intelligent system designed to solve this challenge. Leveraging the power of AI and machine learning, this web-based solution automates the creation of conflict-free and optimized academic timetables. It integrates critical institutional data‚Äîfrom student preferences and faculty availability to classroom capacities‚Äîto ensure a seamless, efficient, and dynamic scheduling process that is fully aligned with the NEP 2020 framework.

üåü Key Features
NEP 2020 Alignment: Specifically built to handle the complexities of FYUP, B.Ed., M.Ed., and ITEP programs, including flexible credits and a wide range of course types.

AI-Powered Optimization: Utilizes AI/ML algorithms to generate optimized timetables that minimize scheduling conflicts, prevent underutilization of resources, and balance faculty workloads.

Centralized Data Management: Accepts and processes structured data inputs from various sources, including:

Student enrollment and course selections.

Curriculum structure (course codes, credits, theory/practical split).

Faculty availability, expertise, and workload.

Room and lab availability and capacity.

Special schedules for teaching practices, fieldwork, and internships.

Dynamic & Scalable: The system is designed for real-time updates and can accommodate changes in course additions, faculty, or NEP guidelines for future semesters without a complete manual overhaul.

User-Friendly Admin Interface: A clean and intuitive dashboard allows administrators to easily input data, simulate different scenarios, and manage the scheduling process with minimal effort.

Exportable Outputs: Generated timetables can be exported in common formats like PDF and Excel, making them easy to distribute to students and faculty.

API Integration: The solution is built to be a standalone system but includes an API to facilitate integration with existing Academic Management Systems (AMS).

‚öôÔ∏è Expected Solution Components
The final solution will be a robust, deployable system with the following core components:

Input Data Module: An interface or API for uploading and managing academic data.

Core AI/ML Engine: The intelligent backend that runs the optimization algorithms to generate timetables.

Conflict Resolution & Validation Module: A system to automatically detect and flag any scheduling clashes related to faculty, students, or rooms.

Admin Dashboard: A web-based interface for system administration, data visualization, and scenario simulation.

Output & Export Module: Functionality to view, print, and export timetables.
